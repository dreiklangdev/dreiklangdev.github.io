This repository researches into possible improvements to Goal-Oriented Reinforcement Learning (RL) by evaluating the Differential Goalkinematic State (DGS), whose components are based on the distance to the goal - in the following called goal-directed derivatives or simply goalderivatives.

The probed improvements include sample-efficiency during training and generality of the resulting policy to unseen goals.
